    "text": "I am a soil physicist broadly trained in agronomy, soil fertility, and plant nutrition. As a researcher, I seek answers to the fundamental questions about agricultural water management and soil health amelioration in the different (agro)ecosystems. My specific research interests include studying and improving available crop water and nutrient (carbon, nitrogen, etc.) uptake efficiency using machine learning tools.\nCurrently, I’m working with this lab.\nI’m happy to connect with professionals having similar research interests."

Are you interested in working in a collaborative manner with researchers to shed light on the current barriers and risks associated with alternative agricultural practices? If so, we invite you to apply to participate in this focus group which will be analyzing the value proposition of our research project on crop diversity and climate change adaptation.\nThis research project is organised by McGill University researchers, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, le Groupe Proconseil and Regeneration Canada. This event is part of a MAPAQ project evaluating whether or not crop diversity is a solution to A) building soil organic matter and reducing reliance on pesticides and B) increasing crop and soil resiliency to changing precipitation."
