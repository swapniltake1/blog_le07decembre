Are you a producer or do you have decision-making power on an agricultural project in the Montérégie region? Are you interested in working in a collaborative manner with researchers to shed light on the current barriers and risks associated with alternative agricultural practices? If so, we invite you to apply to participate in this focus group which will be analyzing the value proposition of our research project on crop diversity and climate change adaptation. 

This research project is organised by McGill University researchers, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, le Groupe Proconseil and Regeneration Canada. This event is part of a MAPAQ project evaluating whether or not crop diversity is a solution to A) building soil organic matter and reducing reliance on pesticides and B) increasing crop and soil resiliency to changing precipitation.
